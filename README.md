# Neural Network in Pure NumPy
An implementation of vanilla neural network (Fully Connected Neural Network) in NumPy only.

I implemented Batch Gradient Descent, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

The dataset used in this repository was downloaded from [here](http://datacenter.aucegypt.edu/shazeem/).

You will find two Jupyter Notebooks:

1- [simplest_neural_network](https://github.com/farisalasmary/neural-network-numpy/blob/master/Neural%20Network/simplest_neural_network.ipynb): this notebook contains the minimal code to create 3-layer neural network. I think this notebook is better for people who want to understand the basic building blocks of neural networks.


2- [organized_neural_network](https://github.com/farisalasmary/neural-network-numpy/blob/master/Neural%20Network/organized_neural_network.ipynb): this network contains the code written in *simplest_neural_network* notebook. I refactor the code and used functions to make it modular.
